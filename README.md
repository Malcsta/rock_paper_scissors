# Rock, Paper Scissors

## Description
This project is just a simple console based game ill use to 
practice basic logic. I have implemented a scoring feature, and
in my spare time plan on working on the if statements to be less
repetitive. I've also implemented a slowtype function, my first 
module, which I used to play around with pythons import capabilities.
